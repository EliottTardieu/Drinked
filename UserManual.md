## How can we order a coffee ?

1. Select any coffee in the list.
2. Choose coffee's size.
3. Check the box if you want to use your personal cup.
4. Set the sugar quantity that you want in your coffee.
5. Confirm your order by clicking on the button "**Confirm**".

## How can you deal with an error ? 

If there is not enough quantity available to order a coffee, you can:

- change capacity
- change coffee
- remove sugar
- call the administrator to add some stuff (knowing that quantity available unit for beverage is **cl**)
